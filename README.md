# Bus-Tracker
I worked with www.mapbox.com and https://new.mta.info/developers to collect data and create a live map of the bus routes between MIT and Harvard's campus. I created functional code that moved the marker between the different bus stop locations on the map. 

## How To Run
Clone/download the following files:
- index.html
- eyes.js
- styles.css 

Create an access token at Mapbox.com (i.e. mapboxgl.accessToken = 'your token';).
Find a map layout that you would like to implement. Once the files are downloaded, drag the index.html file onto your browser window. Click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to see the map marker move.

## Future Improvements
- add a 3d layout
- expand the routes
- mark when the bus is at full compacity
