# Bus-Tracker
This was my class project working with www.mapbox.com and new.mta.info/developers to collect data and create a live map of the bus routes between Mit and Harvard campus. I created function that moved the buses between the different  locations on the map. 

## How to get started 
- Clone files: index.html, eyes.js, and styles.css 
- Create an access token @ Mapbox.com   example: "mapboxgl.accessToken = 'your token';"
- Find a map layout that you would like to implement

## What i plan on improving
- add a 3d layout
- expand the routes
- mark when the bus is at full compacity
